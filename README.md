# 3D-Unity-FPS
This is our first project in the Unity Engine. This Project is currently unnamed, and it will eventually become an online Arena Shooter when we are finished. Right now we have implemented player models, HD Shaders through the High Definition Render Pipeline and simple networking using Photon Unity Networking (PUN).
